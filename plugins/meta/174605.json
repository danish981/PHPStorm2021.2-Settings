Eliminate context-switching and simplify code discussion and code review by putting collaboration tools in your IDE.</p>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream/develop/jb/docs/images/CSforJB4.png\" alt=\"CodeStream for JetBrains\"></p>\n\n<h1>Integrations</h1>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Code Hosts:</b> Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed</li>\n    <li><b>Issue Trackers:</b> Asana, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self-Managed, Jira, Linear, Shortcut, Trello, YouTrack</li>\n    <li><b>Observability:</b> New Relic, Microsoft Pixie</li>\n    <li><b>Messaging Services:</b> Slack, Microsoft Teams</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Requirements</h1>\n<ul>\n    <li>CodeStream requires version 2021.2.1 or later of any JetBrains IDE, and is also available for <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream\">VS Code</a> or <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream-vs\">Visual Studio</a>.</li>\n    <li>Your repository must be managed by Git, or a Git hosting service like GitHub.</li>\n    <li>For Windows users, CodeStream now requires a 64-bit version of the OS.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Create and Review GitHub and GitLab Pull Requests in your IDE</h1>\n<p>Create, review and merge GitHub pull requests and GitLab merge requests inside your IDE, with full source-tree and full file access, your favorite keybindings, built-in diff tool, and code intelligence.</p>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream/develop/jb/docs/images/PullRequest-JB_700.gif\" alt=\"Pull Request\"></p>\n\n<h1>Get Feedback on Work-in-Progress with Pre-PR Code Reviews</h1>\n<p>CodeStream's lightweight feedba`ck requests let you get feedback on your changes regardless of the current state of your repo, without the friction of committing, pushing or issuing a pull request. Your teammates can review your changes right in their IDE, with full file context, and with no need to set aside their current work to switch branches or pull the latest.</p>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream/develop/jb/docs/images/FRPerform-JB_700.gif\" alt=\"Review Changes\"></p>\n<br>\n<p>CodeStream’s feedback requests are so easy that you can start doing them throughout the development process instead of waiting until the end. You’re a few days into a sprint and have some work stubbed out? Maybe some work that hasn’t even been committed. Get feedback on your work-in-progress so that you can identify and resolve issues early instead of saving those gotchas for when you need to get the code merged.</p>\n\n<h1>Simplified Code Discussion</h1>\n<p>Rather than copying &amp; pasting, CodeStream enables in-editor commenting on any code in your repository, with optional sharing to Slack, MS Teams or via email, with automatic at-mentioning of code authors via git blame.</p>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream/develop/jb/docs/images/DiscussCode1-JB_700.gif\" alt=\"Discuss Code\"></p>\n<br>\n<p>Your teammates can participate in the discussion right from their IDE, or from Slack, Teams, or replying to the email.</p>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamCodeStream/CodeStream/master/images/ShareOnSlack1.png\" alt=\"Share on Slack\"></p>\n\n<h1>Add Observability to your IDE</h1>\n<p>Resolve production errors faster and improve software performance by bringing production telemetry from New Relic into your IDE. Operations and dev teams can identify application owners quickly and work together to resolve critical errors.</p>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream/develop/jb/docs/images/Observability-JB_700.gif\" alt=\"Observability\"></p>\n<br>\n<p>In a single click, you can jump from Errors Inbox on New Relic to their IDE and step through the stack trace for code-level debugging of high-impact errors. Additionally, discover, view, filter, and update the status of open issues all from the comfort of your favorite IDE.</p>\n\n<h1>Build the Knowledge Base Behind Your Codebase</h1>\n<p>CodeStream turns conversation into documentation by capturing all of the discussion about your code, and saving it with your code. Comment and code review threads are automatically repositioned as your code changes, even across branches. All with zero effort on your part.</p>\n<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream/develop/jb/docs/images/KnowledgeBase1-JB_700.gif\" alt=\"Knowledge Base\"></p>\n<br>\n<p>Previously discussed questions and issues that explain important decisions are now accessible right where you need them, when you need them. Just click on the codemark to expand it and see how something works or why something was done a certain way.</p>\n\n<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>\n\n<h4>Where are messages stored?</h4>\n<p>Your team’s codemarks, which include the message text and the code snippet, are stored in the cloud on CodeStream’s servers. CodeStream uses best practices when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.codestream.com/security\">security</a>.\n\n</p><h1>Help &amp; Feedback</h1>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/codestream/\">user guide</a> for more information on getting started with CodeStream.
