### Personal settings for phpstorm2021.2 

I'm using phpstorm2021 for a long time and I understand it deeply. I somehow optimized it for my personal use.


- Disabling the plugins that I don't need right now
- Disabling some intensions
- Disabling some inspectins
- Disabling browsers
- Disabling background running tasks like Indexing (pretty annoying when runs at every start)
- and few others minor items disabled, 


#### I really enjoy writing code in phpstorm | thank you Jetbrains for such a nice tool
